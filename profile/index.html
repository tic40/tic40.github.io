<li>Birth: 1986/08/23</li>
<li>Address: Tokyo</li>
</ul>

<p>Software engineer in Tokyo.</p>

<p>I learned computer science at university.
After that, I started my career in banking as bank clerk(it&rsquo;s not software engineer. I was interested in finance at that time)</p>

<p>I quitted the bank company in 1 year to help my father&rsquo;s business(cause my father has a disease).
I managed the business instead of my father for 3 years.</p>

<p>However this business was closed unfortunately.
Then I restarted my career as a software engineer in 2012.</p>

<p>Now I have experienced over 6 years of experience as a software engineer.
1 small company(5 employees), 1 listed company(more than 100 employees) and a startup company.</p>

<p>I love to design software, solve problems and give good experience through the web to users.</p>

<p>The most important thing to build great software for me is teamwork.
I interested in team management as well.
Always thinking what I should do to enhance the team output.</p>
